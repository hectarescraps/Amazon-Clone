## About the Project

Amazon Clone built with React and Firebase. The clone features the following functioning pages: Login, Home Page, Checkout, Payment, and Order History. Payment processing is done through Stripe. If you're curious to see the Stripe integration in action, test card information is located on the /payment page below the Payment Method header.
